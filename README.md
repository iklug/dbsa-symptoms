# DBSA Symptom Tracker

The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA) does incredible work for their community. One of the things I was especially impressed with was the DBSA Wellness Tracker-- a free series of PDFs that can be used to track one's mood, medications, symptoms, etc.. as a means of helping a person more deeply understand their diagnosis and how it might affect-- and be affected by-- different parts of their lives.

The only problem is, you've got to print out all the papers (or maybe edit them with a pdf editor?) Having a printer, not necessarily a given these days. And after printing it out, you'd have to color in boxes with colored pencils.. not a huge problem, but it's a barrier to using a tool that I think some people could truly benefit from. 

I made a simple replication of the Symptom Tracker using React.

Intensity of symptom is edited by simply clicking on the appropriate square. It will cycle through mild, medium, large, extreme and then back to none.

With this quick example, results are saved in localStorage. The idea being that at the end of the month you can save the page as a PDF for safekeeping and you reset to start a new month of symptom tracking.
