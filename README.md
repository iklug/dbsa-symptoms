# DBSA Symptom Tracker

The Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA) does incredible work for their community. One of the things I was especially impressed with was the DBSA Wellness Tracker-- a free series of PDFs that can be used to track one's mood, medications, symptoms, etc.. as a means of helping a person more deeply understand their diagnosis and how it might affect-- and be affected by-- different parts of their lives. 

The only problem is, you've got to print out all the papers (or maybe edit them with a pdf editor?) Having a printer, not necessarily a given these days. And after printing it out, you'd have to color in boxes with colored pencils.. not a huge problem, but it's a barrier to using a tool that I think some people could truly benefit from. 

I made a simple replication of the Symptom Tracker using React.
